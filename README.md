## Overview

The **XML2HTML-Converter-for-University-Systems** project is designed to parse and process XML files, primarily aimed at automating workflows or processing structured data using Python. The project includes basic logging functionality and error handling, making it robust for managing exceptions and tracking the processing status.

## Features

- Parses XML files efficiently
- Basic logging and error handling
- Modular codebase for easy extensibility
- Well-structured for initializing and processing XML data and creating html files

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or above
- Required Python libraries, as specified in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fgeeha/parse_xml_file_volgau.git
cd parse_xml_file_volgau
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OR use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs)

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up environment variables by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

OR

```bash
poetry shell
```

Configure the environment variables as necessary.

## Usage

The main entry point of the application is located in `main.py`. To run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will initiate XML file parsing, and generates an html file with the entrants' rating at the output. Therefore, **you need to put xml files in the root.**

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or opening issues. Ensure that your code follows the repository's existing style and structure.

### Git push tag
#### Create a tag in the `v*.*.*` format
There are two types of tags in Git: lightweight and annotated. It is recommended to use annotated tags, as they contain additional information such as the author, date, and message.

Creating an annotated tag:
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 2.0.3"
```
- `-a` — indicates that the tag is annotated.
- `v2.0.3` — the tag name corresponding to the  `v*.*.*` template.
- `-m "Release version 2.0.3"` — the message for the tag.

#### Push the tag to the remote repository
Push a **specific tag**:

To trigger only one **specific tag**:

```bash
git push origin v2.0.3
```
**Push all tags**:

If you want to push all the local tags that don't exist in the remote repository yet:
```bash
git push origin --tags
```

#### Deleting a tag: 
If you created the wrong tag by mistake, you can delete it locally and in a remote repository.:
```bash
# Delete a local tag
git tag -d v2.0.3

# Remove tag from remote repository
git push origin --delete v2.0.3
```
